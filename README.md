The objective of this notebook is to practice using the “recipe” for exploratory data analysis:

* Learn about your data
* Import libraries
* Set up notebook settings
* Load data
* Check data
* Identify relationships in a pairplot
* Compute summary statistics for numerical variables
* Compute frequency tables for categorical variables
* Explore relationships between variables and potential issues
